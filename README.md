# Demosaicing-using-CNN
This repository contains our code for a CNN architecture solution to the demosaicing problem, based on the paper "Learning Deep Convolutional Networks for Demosaicing" by Chuang et al.
May I ask the author: What is the order of the pre-processing parts of the dataset: "im2patch"„ÄÅ"separator" and "sifter"? I may mistake them so that the result is chaotic. Another question is that "cfa" and "target" in the "train.py" are not defined and I don't know how to deal with it.
